## Key diaper benchmarks

- Newborns should have at least 6 wet diapers per day after day five.
- Pale yellow urine is the goal—darker colors suggest dehydration.
- Log diapers in the tracker to spot dips early.

## Parent hydration hacks

- Keep a water bottle next to the changing station.
- Pair every feeding session with a glass of water.
- Use lightweight reminders during night feeds to avoid alarms that wake the baby.
