## Weekly reset agenda

1. Prioritize a power nap for each caregiver.
2. Prep snack bins with high-protein options.
3. Schedule a ten-minute feelings download with your partner or friend.

## Mental health guardrails

- Add mood check-ins to your tracker three times a week.
- Lean on your Matrix support room to crowdsource ideas and vent safely.
- Reach out to your care provider if intrusive thoughts last longer than two weeks.
