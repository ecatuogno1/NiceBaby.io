## Why routines matter

Short, predictable steps before bedtime help your baby wind down and give you a repeatable checklist when you are exhausted.

- Keep the bedroom lighting dim 30 minutes before bedtime.
- Use the same lullaby and swaddle technique each night.
- Track wake windows in the app so you can respond before overtired cues show up.

## Calming activities to mix and match

1. Warm bath or steamed bathroom to relax muscles.
2. Two minutes of baby massage focusing on legs and tummy.
3. Feeding in a quiet, low-stimulation room.
4. White noise at a consistent volume.

> Tip: Take turns with your partner to complete the routine so everyone gets a stretch break.
